                    <li><span> 4 Coding Problem based on DS and Algo:</span> One problem was on string (Simple),one was
                        on
                        matrix(maths) , one was on dp(Variation of Knapsack) and last one was on simple mathematics.

                        and we have to
                        apply some mathematical operation on the data and print the data </li>
                    <li><span> 4-5 Mcq Based upon Aptitude:</span> Operating System ,DS & Algo,P&C(Aptitude)</li>
                </ul>
